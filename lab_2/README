I was unclear on whether we needed a main.cpp to contain our main function.
I asked on piazza but no one helped me. According to the specs, we only needed
lab2.cpp and lab2.h so my main() function is contained inside lab2.cpp.

Also, I would kindly suggest not changing the specifications so late on the
due date because I spent quite a lot of time over the weekend writing the lab
to older specifications and had to modify it many times. I understand many of
the specs were simplified but I overcame the challenge and feel like I have
thrown away much of my time deleting all the hard work I did to make it work
in conjunction to the new specs. If you would like, I will be glad to point
others in the right direction on piazza. I respond to questions frequently
but it becomes difficult to help others when I constantly have to change
my program.

Kind Regards,
Alex Puh
