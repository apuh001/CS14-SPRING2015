I have updated to your last minute changes in the specifications, but please
let me know if others are having difficulty with labs. I believe this is the
reason for the changes, but I was able to make it work with one of the earlier 
versions of the lab.

Also regarding the tgz file, our SI leaders advised us not to include them
since they are working it out with you, but I have included it anyways. Please
be clear on this in the future.

Kind Regards,
Alex Puh
