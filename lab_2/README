This version of the lab is loyal to the previous specifications where
the List class was seperated between lab2.h and lab2.cpp. I'd appreciate it
if you could overlook the fact that I did not merge the List into a single
lab2.h class as the last minute updated lab2 specs mentioned. I understand
that they were changed because many people found strange messages when 
compiling, but I was able to work through that although it was not an easy 
feat. 

As such, main.cpp will need to #include both lab2.cpp and lab2.h because
I implemented it as the original lab specs said: to split the class into
two files even though we were implementing templates. In the future, you can
encourage others to ask questions if they are having difficulty getting it
to compile and I and others who were able to make it work can point them into
the right direction.

Kind Regards,
