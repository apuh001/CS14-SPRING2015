part a. My selection sort is stable because NO swaps are made when the same     
        equal elements are compared so they keep their same relative ordering.
        As per my tests you can see that the sort remains in the same relative
        order after sorting.

part b. For the test program. I used the test cases from the specifications 
        since they appear to exhibit the stable sort very well.
