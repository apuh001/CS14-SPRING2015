part a. My selection sort appears to be stable, however selection sort is 
        supposedly an unstable sort by itself. For example, the values (1, 1)
        and (1, 1) are changed in their ordering. By tracing the code, we can
        tell that original (1, 1) has changed places with its second (1,1) when
        they are compared to other elements in the container.

part b. For the test program. I used the test cases from the specifications.
        Tracing over them, it appears that the instability is present. We 
        cannot be 100% sure that the elements of equal value will stay in     
        the exact same location relative to each other.
