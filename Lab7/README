Part b of lab:

Advantages of hash tables:
Faster lookups and faster insertion.

Disadvantages of trees:
Slower lookups and insertions as compared to hash tables as elements grow.

It may be interesting too look at the comparisons of removal times and
even time it takes to deallocate memory upon destruction.
